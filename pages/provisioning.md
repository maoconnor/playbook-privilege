Provisioning is the process of assigning access permissions to a user.  

Though privileged users do require more expansive access permissions than the average user, this does not mean that every privileged user requires access to all protected resources. Limiting the scope of resources that a given privileged user can access can limit their potential to do wide-ranging harm to an organization.  

Helpful approaches to this problem include the following:
- Segregation of duties. Distributing parts of a privileged workflow to multiple users, ensuring that no one user can compromise the entire system.
- The principle of least privilege. Granting a privileged user the minimum access needed to perform their job.

Moreover, it is important for an organization to maintain awareness of who is a privileged user and what resources each privileged user has access to.  This awareness can help detect when a user is attempting to access or manipulate a resource that falls outside of their standard job functions.

#### Formalizing the Provisioning Process

To support sensible provisioning, organizations should institute a formal process that:
- ensures privileged users must request elevated access
- vets privileged users for suitability for elevated access
- requires access approval from an entitlement authority
- ends with a signed agreement covering expected behavior, responsibilities, and consequences

Formalizing the privileged user provisioning process makes it clear to all parties what is expected and helps ensure that only suitable individuals are granted elevated access.  It can also remind privileged users of the consequences of allowing unintentional breaches through careless behavior. 

However, these safeguards can become irrelevant if an organization is not using secure, unique credentials.  For Federal agencies, the PIV card provides this level of security assurance.  PIV cards can even provide added security for resources that are not set up to use PIV through the use of tools like a PIV-enabled password vault.
