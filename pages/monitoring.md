Ongoing monitoring helps ensure that security controls are being followed and can detect unauthorized attempts to access or manipulate protected resources.  Risk analytics software can be a strong enabler to this effort.  

Organizations can take the following steps to strength their ongoing monitoring:

- Training and education
Ensuring all users understand the proper procedures and the risks & consequences of not following them, whether intentionally or unintentionally, provides a baseline understanding.
- Access recertification.
Regular checks that privileged users still require access to their set of resources helps keep access permissions current.  Without regular checks, users can maintain access to resources they no longer require and can leave “orphan accounts” after they switch roles or leave an organization.  Recertification could be required as regularly as monthly for individuals with access to highly sensitive resources.
- Session monitoring & anomaly reporting
Identifying activity that deviates from an established baseline can expose malicious actors.  In addition, an organization can implement keystroke logging, session recording, or live session monitoring to provide an extra level of oversight for privileged users with highly elevated permissions.  A notification system that alerts administrators or security personnel when potentially malicious activity is detected can help forestall an ongoing situation from escalating.
- Audits
Regularly auditing logs and recordings can help ensure issues that weren’t detected at the time are discovered and rectified.
- Continuous evaluation of personnel
Privileged users should continually be evaluated for suitability and for the need to access protected resources.  A one-time check during onboard risks missing signs for concern that develop later.
