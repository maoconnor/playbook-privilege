A secure operating environment comes from having the proper tools and processes manage an organization’s cybersecurity as a whole.  These tools provide the groundwork to take specific measures to properly manage privileged users. 
 
They include:

- Network security:
For example, an organization can configure firewalls so that only privileged users with an IP address can access protected resources, or an organization can prohibit the execution of privileged commands via remote access.
- Data protection:
Privileged users generally have access to large amounts of sensitive information.  Encrypting data or restricting the amount of data that can be moved at one time can frustrate or prevent unauthorized attempts to manipulate data.
- Configuration management:
Establishing a secure configuration baseline that applies to all user accounts and prohibiting the installation of malicious or suspect software (a process known as blacklisting) can help ensure that actors are unable to configure the settings and tools needed to conduct an unauthorized manipulation of protected resources.
- Endpoint security:
Computer terminals and peripheral devices should meet predetermined security standards before being connected to an organization’s network.
- Physical security:
Integrating physical and logical security and enabling physical security with tools like video cameras can help to detect and prevent unauthorized attempts to access sensitive areas, such as a privileged user’s computer terminal or a server room.
- Continuity and resiliency planning:
If a data breach happens, an organization that has a fallback plan will be able to recover and stop further damage more quickly.  Backing up data and having an alternate site to operate from can allow organizations to continue working while security experts mitigate and repair damage.

Organizations should be careful to only implement the tools they need given the sensitivity of their information and the threat they face.  Over-securing an organization can backfire, becoming a management nuisance and leading some users to attempt to circumvent or avoid excessive controls.
