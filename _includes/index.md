## Introduction to Privileged User Guides

Properly managing privileged users is an essential element of an organization’s cybersecurity program.  Privileged users, those individuals with elevated access to an organization’s protected resources, have the ability to do extensive damage, whether through carelessness or malicious intent, by improperly accessing or manipulating sensitive information or systems. Fortunately, there are reliable measures organizations can take to prevent and mitigate the potential damage.

#### What is a privileged user?

A privileged user is an individual who has been granted elevated privileges to access protected physical or logical resources, including data, applications, networks, or facilities.  

Generally, privileged users occupy roles that require them to administer or oversee aspects of their organization’s IT systems.  

Examples of privileged users range from a system administrator responsible for overseeing an organization’s data servers to a security guard with the ability to manage turnstiles or access a server room. Other individuals who could be privileged users include application developers, database administrators, data center operations personnel, information technology (IT) security practitioners, IT audit practitioners, maintenance personnel, and network engineers.

#### What is the threat from privileged users?

Privileged users have been behind several recent data breaches that have made headlines.

Some privileged users unintentionally allow unauthorized actors to access sensitive information simply due to neglect or carelessness. Others abuse their roles deliberately. Their motivations include attempting to conduct fraud for personal gain, performing espionage or sabotage, stealing intellectual property, or supporting an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.

#### What can be done?

An organization should take steps in four major areas to prevent and mitigate damage that privileged users can create.  Those steps are covered in detail in the sections on the left.  

In brief, they are: 

- Establish a secure operating environment by securing logical and physical resources
- Rationalize the provisioning framework
- Establish secure runtime access controls
- Implement ongoing monitoring

The overall framework for managing privileged users can be seen in the diagram below.
